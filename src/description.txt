/psensor is a/

It displays a curve for each sensor, and uses Desktop Notification to
raise an alarm when a temperature is too high. On Ubuntu an
Application Indicator is also available, its icon changes when a
temperature alert is raised.

It can monitor:
  * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using lm\-sensors).
  * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
  * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp).
  * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm\-sensors).
  * the sensors of a remote computer (using psensor\-server).

Psensor requires lm\-sensors to be correctly installed and configured,
it can be checked by running the command 'sensors'. If it has never be
done, you may need to run the command 'sensors\-detect' and follow the
instruction. See the manpages of sensors(1) and sensors\-detect(8) for
more information.

To retrieve the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives, the hddtemp
daemon must be running.

For remote monitoring:
  * start psensor\-server(1) on the remote computer
  * run psensor with '\-\-url' option: 'psensor \-\-url=http://localhost:3131'
