Psensor - Temperature Monitoring For Linux
------------------------------------------

Psensor is a graphical temperature monitor for Linux.

It can monitor:

  * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using
    lm-sensors).
  * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
  * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp).
  * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm-sensors).
  * the temperature of a remote computer.

Alarms using Desktop Notification can be set to each sensor to notify
high temperatures.

For Ubuntu users, Psensor is providing an Application Indicator to
alert users when a temperature is too high.

To monitor the temperature of a remote computer:

  * start psensor-server on the remote computer. The default port is
    3131 and can be changed by using the '--port=PORT' command line
    option.

  * start psensor with the '--url' option: 
  psensor --url=http://hostname:3131

WARNING: 
psensor-server does not provide any way to restrict the connection to
the HTTP server, worst, no effort has been made against malicious HTTP
attacks.  You should make the psensor-server port available only to a
network or computer you trust by using the usual network security
tools of the system (for example, iptables).

------------

Ubuntu
------

For Ubuntu, the easy way to install Psensor and Psensor-server is to
use the dedicated PPA.

For the last stable version:
sudo apt-get apt-add-repository ppa:/jfi/psensor
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install psensor

For the last development version:
sudo apt-get apt-add-repository ppa:/jfi/psensor-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install psensor
sudo apt-get install psensor-server

Alternatively, you can download Ubuntu binary packages from:
